For trouble shooting to see if a cam is still up:

open terminal (black dos looking box)

type:

ping 192.168.76.71

(or whatever camera IP address you want to check)

Press [CNTL-C] to exit.


NETWORK SETUP

to add a route to your normal PC for the camera network port so that you can access the camera feeds on your network:

For Windows:
open a DOS prompt as administrator

type:

route add 192.168.76.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 IP_OF_LINUX

where IP_OF_LINUX is this host's IP address. To figure that out, open the terminal and type:

ip a 

then look for something like 192.168.x.x


CAMERA ADMIN
Each camera has its own web admin you can use to access the settings or view the live feed, BUT this admin only works in the OLD Internet Explorer.
Win10 has a verion of this, but you have to search for "Internet Explorer"

Once in IE, go to the cam IP address. 

Login with username : admin 
and no password (blank password)
